| Issue # |	Heuristic #	| Description | Rating | Freqency |	Severity | Impact |	Avg |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| 1       | H1 | There’s no back button in ‘create a flat’ page | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2.75 |
| 2       | H8 | The home page is condensed | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0.75|
| 3       | H7 | Potential to add a confirmation button before adding a payment | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 2 |


**Features to consider:**

- Really appealing and consistent colour scheme throughout the design	
- The calendar is a great feature to visualise the upcoming payments for the flat
- Contributors section was also good feature to see which flatmate is behind on paying shared bills.
- The upcoming payments page was also nice feature to manage and plan for upcoming payments.
