- Inclusion of accessability option good.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| H1 - Visibility of system status  | 0	I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all |	
| H2	Match between system and the real world	| 1	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| H3	User control and freedom	| 2	Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| H4	Consistency and standards	| 3	Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| H5	Error prevention	| 4	Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |
