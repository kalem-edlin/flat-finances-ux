### Heuristic Evaluation of Tomas's Design


| Issue # |	Heuristic #	| Description | Rating | Freqency |	Severity | Impact |	Avg |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| 1       | H1 | Everything seems alright | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0|
| 2       | H2 | Structure + colour looks similar to things you see in real life seems alright | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0|
| 3       | H3 | Quite a bit of hard control, think it might be a bit limiting with only yes/delete but not that much of an issue | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2|
| 4       | H4 | Seems similar/consistant to what you'd expect/see on a banking service etc | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0|
| 5       | H5 | Didn't see any final confirmation or formatting/error checking | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 2|
| 6       | H6 | Home/creating seem very similar/only seems to be 2 pages ie: seeing group status and payment screen, if that's intended then nothing wrong/no problem | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1|
| 7       | H7 | Not sure if I saw anything that allowed for adding an expense to the flat for one off/reoccuring cost? | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2|
| 8       | H8 | Layout/menu seems fine and has the core essentials | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0|
| 9       | H9 | Seems easy to edit/readjust/cancel sections when creating since it's split up into its own thing but don't see anything that shows error prevention/errors | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1|
| 10      | H10| Don't see anything that shows help/tutorial for using the application, everything assumes we know everything and know how to navigate things/expects the user to explorer themself | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3|
	

Colour scheme is good/easy for the eye, 
Menu is great, compact, does it job, easy to read/navigate
Like that creating new things etc is split into sections and smaller secitons to allow deletation for parts but not the entire section.


Think it's missing error message display/invalid entry
Think it's missing Help/Tutorial featurer to display what's being shown, where and what button does/do/where to go
Think its mising a language featurer that translates things on the application to specificed language

Think it's missing the ability to add in one off/reoccuring expenses but I'm not 100% sure myself


| Nielsen's Heuristics | Nielsen's Severity Rating |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| H1 - Visibility of system status  | 0	I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all |	
| H2	Match between system and the real world	| 1	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| H3	User control and freedom	| 2	Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| H4	Consistency and standards	| 3	Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| H5	Error prevention	| 4	Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |
| H6	Recognition rather than recall |		
| H7	Flexibility and efficiency of use |		
| H8	Aesthetic and minimalist design |		
| H9	Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors |		
| H10	Help and documentation |
| |		
| OI	Other issue	|
