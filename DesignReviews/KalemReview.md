#### Pros/Features to consider for final product:

- Debt and dispute system great idea.
- Good use of visual loading bars showing status of pages.
- Good use of well known symbols and formats for menu's.
- Ability to undo actions or revert changes made.
- Overall consistent use of icons.
- Lots of clear error prevention messages.
- Each page usually only consists of 1 or 2 sub pages easy to remember where you are up to.
- Flexibility of use with the most frequently requested items streamlining the process of selecting items.
- Flexibility with the custom shortcuts on the home page, being able to prioritise things of importance to the user.
- Small number of things on the screen at once, not overloading short term memory.

#### Possible additions:

- Maybe have a ? icon at top right of each page that explains everything on the page.
- Could have a request invoice/subscription upload be accessible to all tenants, that the head tenant could then approve.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| H1 - Visibility of system status  | 0	I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all |	
| H2	Match between system and the real world	| 1	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| H3	User control and freedom	| 2	Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| H4	Consistency and standards	| 3	Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| H5	Error prevention	| 4	Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |
| H6	Recognition rather than recall |

| H8	Aesthetic and minimalist design |
