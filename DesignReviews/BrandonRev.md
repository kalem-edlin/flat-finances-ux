### Heuristic Evaluation of Brandon's Design

[Design](https://balsamiq.cloud/sqcxcg3/p4sc4lx/r2278)

| Issue # |	Heuristic #	| Description | Rating | Freqency |	Severity | Impact |	Avg |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| 1       | H1 | Page location isn't always explicit. Tabs at the bottom and back buttons track to some extent, but could possibly become unclear? | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2.25 |
| 2       | H5 | We could add confirmation messages? E.g. 'Are you sure?' before adding payments to prevent mistakes | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 2|
| 3       | H7 | The design as it is only allows the user to create/edit the budget as a whole - the user would need to take a lot of steps to add/edit just one payment. This could be added as a shortcut? | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2.25 |
| 4       | H9 | Similar to above. I can't currently see a way for a user to delete just one payment from the budget? If they entered it wrong, they'd have to redo the whole budget | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2.75 | 			

#### Pros/Features to consider for final product:

- Pie chart with estimated budget for the month is a nice, clear way of viewing data + making predictions
- Option to manage personal spending vs. flat spending
- Pretty clear workflow around homepage/budgets/create a new budget. Simple and functional.


| Nielsen's Heuristics | Nielsen's Severity Rating |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| H1 - Visibility of system status  | 0	I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all |	
| H2	Match between system and the real world	| 1	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| H3	User control and freedom	| 2	Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| H4	Consistency and standards	| 3	Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| H5	Error prevention	| 4	Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |
| H6	Recognition rather than recall |		
| H7	Flexibility and efficiency of use |		
| H8	Aesthetic and minimalist design |		
| H9	Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors |
