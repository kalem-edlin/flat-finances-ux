# flat-finances-ux

A collaborative university project in which user experience design principles were strictly applied to a prototype for a flat finance management app.

I played a vital role in the project by supplying the work in justifying design choices to align with user experience principles like Jakob Nielsen's heuristics. I also lead the team in designing the wireframes making sure the prototype covered all functionalities and intended user experience aspects. I also created the video to cover the prototype and its functionalities/design choices in under 5 minutes.
